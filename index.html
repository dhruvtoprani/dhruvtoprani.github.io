 <h2> Public Speaking</h2>
 <p>With years of professional public speaking, under my belt, I consider this to be one of my most polished skills. From ranking 3rd across the entire UAE to being a certified competent communicator and leader, the journey has taught me a lot. Having understood the fundamentals of effective communication ranging from vocal variety, research, persuasion, and inspiration, I'm currently dwelling deeper into the art of Storytelling.</p>

        <h2> Photography </h2>
     <p>I remember getting my first proper DSLR as a Diwali gift. Over the past few years, I've attended workshops to sharpen my technical knowledge, and have largely benefitted from trying to capture photos in all sorts of settings, lighting, conditions, and not to forget a vast majority of photos I've taken were from a moving car or bike. Having tried different forms of photography, I've developed a level of proficiency in Urban, Street, and Portrait photography.</p>
        </div>
       <div class="service-item">
<h2> Photoshop </h2>
<p>I've been using Adobe Photoshop ever since I was 10, what started as a 5th graders' Friday evening pass time has now allowed me to tackle multiple challenges on the creative front. Over years of practice and experimenting with crazy ideas, this skill of mine not helps me keep my creative bones active.

    <h2> Web Design </h2>
 <p>What started off as a hobby has now become a part of my skillset, with that being siad there's still a lot more for me left to learn, understand and discover.</p>
